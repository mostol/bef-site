  <h2>Knowledge is (girl) power.</h2>
  <p>
    In townships in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, only 7% high school graduates are able to find jobs. The impact of unemployment is particularly devastating for young South African women, who face more limited job opportunities while also providing for parents and siblings, navigating single parenthood, or struggling against extreme poverty.
  </p>
  <p>
    The gift of education offers these young women an opportunity to rewrite their circumstances. For them, education isn't just a key to higher wages; according to the UN it's <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2017/06/millions-could-escape-poverty-by-finishing-secondary-education-says-un-cultural-agency/">central to escaping</a> the generations-long cycles of impoverishment, discrimination, and struggle that they inherit.

    A degree can unlock a future in the local job market or the skills to establish a businessâ€”and most importantly, self-sufficiency foor them, their families, and their communities.

  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>
    The Brockbank Education Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing scholarships for young Latter-day Saint women in South Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 1999, the Fund has supported nearly 90 students from the Eastern Cape Province area and raised over $100,000. With help from people like you, these girls have pursued a variety of degrees, ranging from accounting, to medicine, to hotel management, to education, to cooking, to beauty school. These degrees have changed lives of these young women by giving them a future in the local job market and making the impossible possible.
