  <p>The Brockbank Education Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing scholarships for young Latter-day Saint women in South Africa, giving them an opportunity to pursue higher education and develop the skills necessary to support themselves and their families through the local job market and beyond.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    While spending 18 months in South Africa as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Kay Brockbank Webber became aware of the many needs of the communities in which she served. It became clear to her that the greatest hope for the future of the area lay in the education of its young people, and especially its young women. Kay and her husband, Bob, founded the Brockbank Education Fund in 1999, in an ambitious effort to help lift these women to new heights.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Brockbank Education Fund is named for Kay's father, Isaac Brockbank, who believed emphatically in education for women as he supported the education of his nine daughters. These daughters joined Kay in financing the first year of the fund, and have continued to support the fund throughout their lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kay passed away in 2004—since then, her family has carried on her vision.

  <h2>Operation</h2>
  <p>The Fund is administered by a local board (including 3 former students) in East London, South Africa. The board receives the applications and interviews the candidates. This board and the Fund's South Africa-based director work very closely with the local schools, universities, and training facilities to ensure students receive the education and training they need to secure their goals.</p>
  <p>
    Funds raised by the BEF are paid directly to the schools and each girl is reviewed every year by the board.  Every possible dollar of the donations is sent to South Africa. To help ensure sustainability, the students agree to do their best to repay the Brockbank Education Fund and serve their community when they can by giving others an opportunity to pursue their own dreams and better their society.
